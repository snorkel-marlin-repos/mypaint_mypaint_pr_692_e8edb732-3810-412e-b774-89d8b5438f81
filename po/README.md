# Translating mypaint

## Translating libmypaint

libmypaint is the brush engine library that MyPaint uses.
It has its own WebLate project, hosted by the WebLate devs (thanks!)
You can translate libmypaint at <https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/mypaint/>.

The rest of this document covers translating
the MyPaint application itself, minus libmypaint.

# Information for coders and maintainers

We use [GNU gettext][gettext] for runtime translation of program text.

## After updating program strings

After changing any string in the source text which makes use of the
gettext macros, you will need to manually run

    scons translate=all

and then commit the modified `po/mypaint.pot` & `po/*.po` too,
along with your changes.

The `.pot` file alone can be updated by running `scons translate=pot`,
if all you want to do is compare diffs.

# Information for translators

## New translation

Start by putting a new stub `.po` file into this directory.

To make such a file you can
copy the header from an existing `.po` file
and modify it accordingly.

Unless there are several country-specific dialects for your language,
the file should be named simply `ll.po`
where "ll" is a recognized [language code][ll].

If there are several dialects for your language,
the file should be named `ll_CC.po`
where "CC" is the [country code][CC].

Before you can work on it,
you will need to update the `.po` file
from the most recent `.pot` template file
generated by the developers.

## Update translation

Before working on a translation,
update the `po` file for your language.
For example, for the French translation, run:

    scons translate=fr

## Use/Test the translation

After modifying the translation,
you need to rebuild to see the changes:

    scons

To run MyPaint with a specific translation on Linux,
you can use the LANG environment variable
like this (the locale needs to be supported):

    LANG=ll_CC.utf8 ./mypaint

where "ll" is a [language code][ll], and and "CC" is a [country code][CC].
Your working directory must be the root directory of the mypaint source.

To run MyPaint with the original strings, for comparison,
you can use the `LC_MESSAGES` variable like this:

    LC_MESSAGES=C ./mypaint

## Send changes

Before you send your changes, please make sure that
your changes are based on the
current development (git) version of MyPaint.

We prefer changes as [Github pull requests][PR],
but if you do not know git just send
either a unified diff or the updated .po file
along with your name to: *a.t.chadwick (AT) gmail.com*.

If you are interested in keeping the transalations up to date,
please subscribe to *mypaint-discuss (AT) gna.org*.
