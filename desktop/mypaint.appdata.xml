    <p>
      MyPaint is a fast, free, and easy graphics app for digital painters.
      It lets you focus on the art you make instead of the program you make it with.
      You can work on your canvas without clutter,
      and show the interface only when you need it.
      MyPaint works best with a graphics tablet.
    </p>
    <p>
      MyPaint’s brush engine is fast and almost infinitely configurable to simulate
      many natural media brushes or experimental ‘unrealistic’ ones.
      It ships with a variety of pre-made brushes by prominent artists,
      so you don’t have to configure your own if you don’t want to.
